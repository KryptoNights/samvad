# Samvad

Samvad is a cross-chain forum where you are incentivised to have meaningful discussions. The more people engage with your thoughts, the more you earn. Think of it as Hacker News, but decentralized and incentivised.

## How it works

You can make a post for free, but replies cost tokens. If you reply to a post, all the tokens go to the poster. When someone replies to your reply, you get half the tokens they give, and the other half is split between the person you reply to (parent of your reply) and the parent of that parent.

This incentivises people to make meaningful posts and replies, and to engage with other people's posts. Incentives don't die out as you go deeper into the thread.

## How to use

The usage is 2 step. First you give in some tokens to the contract, and then you can use those tokens to make posts and replies. All rewards you get through people engaging with you automatically get added to your balance. You can withdraw your balance at any time.

## Not on Ethereum? Not a problem.

Samvad is cross-chain. While we treat Ethereum as our base chain, you can use any supported chain to interact with Samvad through Chainlink's CCIP. All supported chains have functions through which you can deposit and withdraw tokens, and make posts and replies. All supported networks have a native deployment of the token, so you can use the same token across all chains.

## Which token

On testnet, we use Chainlink's BnM token. On mainnet, we will use our own token, which will be distributed through an airdrop. The token will be used to participate in the forum and to vote on proposals to change the incentive structure and tokenomics. This makes Samvad a DAO.
